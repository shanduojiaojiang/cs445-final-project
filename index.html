<h1>CS 445 Final Project: Image Segmentation</h1>

<h2>Part 1: Hybrid Image</h2>
<br/>
<h4>My favorite result: </h4>
<img src="./images/john-nun.jpg" alt="john-dog" height="450">

<p>
	<br/> This is my favorite hybrid image result out of all the experiments.
			When you look close at the computer, you will see John Wick (Keanu Reeves)
			handsome as always, but when you step a few meters away, you will see that
			it's acually a picture of The Nun. In this example, I chose 7 for the cut-off
			frequency of low-pass filter, and 8 for the cut-off frequency of high-pass filter.
	<br/>
	<br/> Throughout the experiment of using different cut-off frequencies as well as
			different pictures, I realized that whether the hybridization of image will
			success depends highly on whether the two input images are already roughly
			similar to each other - for example, if the two input images are both portraits
			and whether people in the portraits have the same pose.

<h4>Other results</h4><br/>

<br/>
<br/>


<p>This is a successful result of the hybrid image - you will see a pineapple when you're
	close to the screen, and an MK2 grenade when you are far from the scree. In this example, I
	chose 9 for the cut-off frequency of low-pass filter, and I chose 12 for the cut-off
	frequency of high-pass filter. The reason behind the success of this example is that the shape of
	grenade and the shape of pineapple are roughly the same. In addition, during this experiment,
	I realized that it is easier to align two objects by placing eye election points on the border than
	placing them inside.

<br/>
<br/>

<p>This is another example of the successful hybrid images - you will see The Punisher
	(Jon Bernthal) when you are close to the screen, and his iconic skull when you take a
	few steps back. In this example, I chose 8 for the cut-off frequency of low-pass filter,
	and I chose 10 for the cut-off frequency of high-pass filter.
</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>This is an example of the failure of hybrid images. I was trying to achieve change of
	expressions by viewing the picture in different distances. However, the low-passed
	Einstein was facing the camera in a different angle than the high-passed Einstein,
	therefore it is impossible for the two images to align perfectly.

<h2>Part 2: Image Enhancement</h2><br/>
<h4>Contrast Enhancement</h4><br/>
<img src="./images/contrast.jpg" height="450">
<p>This is a picture of Golden Bridge that I took a year ago. As you can see on the left,
	the original image looks misty and has a poor contrast, while the image on the
	right after contrast enhancement looks clearer and has a strong third dimension. For
	the implementation of contrast enhancement, I chose histogram equalization as it could
	redistribute pixel values on a linear level.


</p>

<br/>
<h4>Color Enhancement</h4><br/>
<img src="./images/disney-color-enhance.jpg" height="580">
<p>This is a picture that I took in Disney World this summer.
	For color enhancement, I first converted the color space to HSV and separated saturation
	from hue and value. Then I normalized saturation by dividing each pixel's saturation by 255,
	and used a gamma correction with &#947 = 0.6. As you can see on the right, image after color
	enhancement looks more vivid and has a brighter color than the original image.
</p>
<br/>

<h4>Color Shift</h4><br/>
<img src="./images/color-shift.jpg" height="580">
<p>This is a picture that I took on the plane when I was flying back to China last summer.
	For color shifting, I first converted the color space to LAB and separated each channel.
	In order to achieve a more red image, I added 10 to a(the difference between green and red),
	and in order to achieve a less yellow image, I subtracted 10 from b(the difference between
	blue and yellow). As you can see in the middle is the <q>reddish</q> image, and on the right is
	the <q>less-yellow</q> image.
