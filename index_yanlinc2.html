<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
For our final project, my partner and I decided to implement Image Segmentation - the process
of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects).
We achieved our result using two clustering algorithms: K-means and Mean Shift. In this project page,
we present you the results of these two different algorithms, the pros and cons of each algorithm,
and the "Andy Warhol" effect we added.
</p>
<br/>

<h3>K-Means in Detail</h3>
<h5>Algorithm Overview</h5>
<p>K-means is probably the most intuitive and straight-forward approach for Image Segmentation -
  In order to segment the image, we simply define a K and divide the image into K regions based
  on color similarity. A detailed implementation of K-Means is shown below:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>Initialization</i>:
  <br/>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- Choose K cluster center
  <br/>
  <i>Repeat</i>:
  <br/>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- Assignment Step: For every point, find its closest center.
  <br/>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- Update Step: Update every center as the mean of its points
  <br/>
  <i>Until</i>:
  <br/>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- The maximum number of iterations is reached, or
  <br/>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- No changes during the assignment step, or
  <br/>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp- The average distortion per point drops very little.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <i>Note: K-Means objective minimizes the total distortion (sum of squared distances of points
  from their cluster centers) as shown in the below equation.</i>

<h5>Finding K</h5>
<p>
  One of the biggest drawbacks of using K-Means is that we need to manually find the most suitable K.
  As suggested in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-image-segmentation-with-k-means-clustering-83fd0a9e2fc3">Towards Data Science</a>
  as well as in <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs131_fall1617/lectures/lecture13_kmeans_mean_shift_cs131_2016">Stanford Vision Lab</a>,
  we tried different values of K and plotted the
  Sum-of-Square Differences versus K to find the "elbow point" where adding one more cluster does not
  reduce much of the SSD. For illustration purpose, we plotted the SSD Vs. K for the Princess Diana image,
  and as indicated by the plot, the "elbow point" here should be 5.

  During experimenting with K-Means, we utilized the clustering of K-Means and reassigned pixel values
  to these pixel groups to achieve a pop art effect - specifically, we implemented an

  as shown below.

<h5>Conclusions on K-Means</h5>
<p>In conclusion, K-Means is a relatively simple and fast algorithm for small K, and it is easy to implement.
  Yet it also has some non negligible cons: 1. Manually choosing K is a relatively heavy overhead. 2. K-Means
  is very sensitive to outliers. 3. All clusters have the same values (distance feature is non-adaptive). Therefore
  in industry today, K-Means is rarely used in pixel segmentation. 
  But the Andy Warhol effect surely is fun.

<h3>Mean Shift in Detail</h3>
<h5>Algorithm Overview</h5>
<p>
  Mean-shift segmentation is an advanced and versatile iterative algorithm for 
  clustering-based segmentation that can be used for locating the maxima of a 
  density function (aka a mode-seeking algorithm). 
  In the context of images, it can be used to cluster similar pixels
  together by using a technique called kernel density estimate (KDE).
  It is model-free and does not assume any prior shapes
  (spherical, elliptical, etc.) on data clusters. 
</p>

<br/>


<br/>
<h5>Intuition and Implementation</h5>
<p>
  The intuition behind mean-shift is a so-called gradient ascent approach, 
  as illustrated by the simple 1D-KDE graph below:
</p>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md">
<img src="./images/KDE.png" height='300'>
</div></div></div>
<p>
  In this graph, we construct a function (in this case
  Gaussian) around each data points, then sum all of them to obtain a so called kernel density 
  estimation. We then move each of these points upwards to their local maxima. 
  This concludes one iteration, and we repeat until all points remain unmoved
  , or as we like to say, converges. 
</p>
<p>
  Now translating this to a general algorithm, let a kernel function K be given, 
  this will determine the weights of nearby points for re-estimating the mean, 
  as given by the following formula, where N(x) means neighboring points of x, 
  and (x_i - x) is determined by the chosen distance function:
</p>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md">
<img src="./images/formula.png" height='100'>
</div></div></div>
<p>
  In the original paper by Fukunaga and Hostetler, m(x) is called a mean-shift
  vector. Now the new x will be m(x), and we do this for all points, and repeat
  until it converges. Notice this looks just like a weighted average! So think
  of mean-shift algorithm as a way to shift the points towards the means. 
  <br/>
  Also, unlike k-means where you will have to choose the number of clusters, 
  mean-shift does that automatically. The only input it really needs is h, 
  called bandwidth, which determines how large the search window would be. 
  When you choose a Gaussian kernel as K, the sigma (variance) would be the 
  bandwidth parameter. It is worth noting that the selection of bandwidth
  is non-trivial, as it determines the quality of result. 
</p>

<p>
  To demonstrate how mean-shift looks in action, kindly examine the process via
  pixelated images below. Here you can see pixels whose color are similar 
  gradually becomes even more similar, and eventually looks like one and the 
  same. For example, pay attention to how red and yellow colors all became brown
  at last.

<br/>

<p>
  In my implementation, I chose a Gaussian kernel, and used Euclidean distance
  for the distance function. 
  For feature space, I tried using Lab color space, HSV and RGB, but finally 
  settled for RGB because it seems to do a pretty good job on most images. 
  While the vanilla implementation is simple, it is actually non-scalable, 
  because you have to calculate weights for each points, which will blow up
  exponentially. There are different ways to speedup the computation, including
  using a flat kernel (instead of Gaussian) and Ball Tree to look up
  members of each kernel as implemented in sklearn, which still have a complexity
  of O(n^2).

  Mean-shift algorithm is a popular segmentation approach in vision because
  it is general and simple to understand/implement. Some applications include
  clustering and tracking. Here we present mean-shift clustering as a way to 
  automatically segment out different regions as a preprocessing step. 
  We demonstrate this process using the skyline photo (the one above). In the
  image to the left below, you can see a label map indicating which pixels belong to which
  groups. Specifically, in the right image, the pixels of the sky are marked as
  bright yellow.

  </div>
</div>
<br/>

<p>
  We then can do lots of stuff with the segmented image like throwing the  
  rest of the image into a CNN to classify
  stuff (so we can reduce computation complexity), or we can also use it as a
  green screen and add some background to it, as shown below.

<br/>
<h5>Conclusions on Mean-Shift</h5>
<p>
  In a nutshell, mean-shift is an excellent general purpose clustering algorithm
  that can be used on almost any dataset due to the fact that it does not assume
  anything about the cluster shape, nor does it assume how many modes there will
  be like k-means. Instead, using KDE and gradient ascent as its intuition, 
  mean-shift can achieve a much better result then k-means in terms of semantics
  segmentation, with the cost of O(n^2) computation complexity. It should also
  be noted that the window size (aka bandwidth) is non-trivial to choose, and 
  can make or break a mean-shifted image. In practice, adaptive bandwidth 
  choosing is preferred.
